1	Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country .	O B-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG B-PER I-ORG O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O B-PER O O B-PER O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
2	President Bush points this way today , even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money , premiums go up and either way , the patient pays .	B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O
3	We 're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader , and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano .	B-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O B-ORG I-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER O
4	BEGALA Dr. Palmisano , again , thanks for staying with us through the break .	O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O
5	Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else 's lawsuits , but instead focus on his own experience .	O B-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER B-PER I-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O

7	It turns out that he did n't do any kind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas .	O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O B-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER B-GPE O
8	Here 's what the " Dallas Morning News " reported recently : " The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners , the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations .	O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O B-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER B-ORG I-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER O

11	Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade . "	O O O O O O O O O O O O
12	That is the Bush record in policing surgeons , why should we trust him now ?	O O O B-PER O O O B-PER O O O B-PER O B-PER O O
13	PALMISANO Well , first off ... BEGALA Physicians generally , not just surgeons , forgive me .	O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O B-PER O O B-PER O
14	PALMISANO Sure .	O O O
15	What we need to do is to make sure that state boards , number one , have adequate funding .	O B-PER O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-ORG O O O O O O O O
16	The AMA supports that .	B-ORG I-ORG O O O
17	If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine .	O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER B-ORG O B-PER O O O O O O O
18	But it 's also ... ( CROSSTALK ) BEGALA ... bad doctors ?	O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O
19	PALMISANO Well , it 's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
20	Because someone pays money in a case , the insurance company may pay money because they 're afraid there 's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system .	O B-PER O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

25	Even file a claim .	O O O O O
26	And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money , not the 90 percent who never file a claim , amounts to less than what we spend on dog food .

27	On dog food .	O O O O
28	It 's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out .	O O O O O O O O O
29	That 's a fraction of physician income .	O O O O O B-PER O O
30	It 's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
31	PALMISANO What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here .	O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
32	That 's what the people in Congress have to do .	O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER B-ORG O O O O

35	Is that right ?	O O O O
36	They do n't abandon their patients , except for the high premiums of a few specialties ?	B-PER O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
37	PALMISANO Because of the premiums .	O O O O O O
38	But first of all let me ... NADER Why do n't you crack down on the insurance companies ?	O O O O O B-PER O O O O O B-PER O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O

45	It 's a company not for profit .	B-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
46	What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
47	And as far as the investment income , A.M. Bests ( ph ) show that in the past five years , the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent .	O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
48	Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis .	B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O
49	( CROSSTALK ) NADER ... payoffs have been stable , adjusted for inflation , National Practitioners Databank ( ph ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
50	Why do you want that to be secret ?	O O B-PER O O O O O O
51	All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank , you , the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list .

475	Scott 2004-11-01T18:06:00 I wish I could have been at a Pub , or wherever these people convene , to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning ( emphasis added ) : Britain 's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target , curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years , according to an international firearms legislation expert .

476	Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crimes , such as the Dunblane massacre , were aberrations .

497	It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush .	O O O B-ORG B-GPE I-ORG O O O O B-ORG O O O O B-PER I-PER O
498	Why you ask ?	O B-PER O O
499	But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
500	From a European perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House .	O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG B-PER I-ORG I-ORG O
501	One is the death of Yasser Arafat .	O O O O O B-PER I-PER O
502	No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli-Palestinian dispute .	O O O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O B-GPE O O
503	For the last few years , Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat .	O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-PER O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O B-PER O
504	That another reason why I respect Bush so much , his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat .	O O O O B-PER O B-PER O O O B-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER B-PER O
505	May he rot in hell .	O B-PER O O B-LOC O
506	But since Arafat 's death , Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground : supporting Ariel Sharon 's withdrawal from Gaza , putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and , covertly , backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader .	O O B-PER O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O B-LOC O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O B-PER I-PER B-GPE I-PER O
507	A second reason is Europe 's growing worries about Islamic terrorism .	O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-PER O O
508	The murder in November of Theo van Gogh , a provocative Dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe 's 9 / 11 .	O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER O B-PER I-PER B-GPE I-PER O O O O O B-PER B-PER I-PER O O O B-GPE O O O O O
509	Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable , it is certainly true that American conservatives , such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis , have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O B-PER I-PER O B-PER I-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
510	You mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes ?	B-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O
511	Get outta here .... Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about .	O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER B-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O
512	The third force is the reappearance , albeit in a milder form , of the threat that kept the trans-Atlantic alliance together for half a century .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE B-LOC I-GPE O O O O O O
513	The Russian bear is growling again .	B-GPE B-GPE I-GPE O O O O
514	The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin 's determination to control his " near abroad . "	O B-GPE O O O O O B-ORG O O B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O
515	They should be very worried about this item , I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was .	B-PER O O O O O O O O B-PER O B-PER O O O B-GPE O O O B-GPE O O O
516	Hopefully our Government is n't asleep at the wheel with this situation either .	O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
517	There is a personal edge to all this .	O O O O O O O O O
518	Just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor , there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate Texan .	O O B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER B-ORG I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER O
519	Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history : that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House .	B-PER B-GPE I-PER O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-PER O B-PER I-PER I-PER B-PER I-PER B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
520	His thumping re-election , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion .	B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O
521	In short , Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception , but the U.S. itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it .	O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-PER B-PER O B-PER I-PER O O B-GPE I-GPE B-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE B-GPE O O O B-GPE O O O B-GPE O
522	Strangely enough , this has been Tony Blair 's strategy all along ; it is rapidly becoming the Continent 's strategy , too .	O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O

547	One of my fellow eggers posted it , so Chet , here 's your credit : A traveler was driving through Arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway .	B-PER I-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O B-PER O O O B-PER O O B-PER I-PER O O O B-GPE O B-PER O B-PER O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O

619	In this case , the most interesting twist is that he 's shorting shares of Mylan 's acquisition target , King Pharmaceuticals ; he 's basically doubling down on the bet that they wo n't acquire .

625	I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
626	The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business .	O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
627	I expected to see a small gathering of idealistic , slightly naive MBA students .	B-PER O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O
628	What I found was a packed room of 200 intelligent , practical,driven idealists .	O B-PER O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O
629	These students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change .	B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
630	I left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders .	B-PER O B-FAC I-FAC O B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER B-ORG I-PER O
631	Fast forward 10 years .	O O O O O
632	Students for Responsible Business is now called Net Impact .	B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
633	In 2004 , I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School .	O O O B-PER O O O O O B-ORG O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
634	Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni .	B-ORG I-ORG O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O
635	Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference .	B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O
636	The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship , sustainable profitability , working with passion .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
637	I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world .	B-PER O B-PER O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O
638	These students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world .	B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O

640	I can tell you that I am seeing a powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools .	B-PER O O B-PER O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
641	It is not coming from the faculty , or the alumni , or the administration .	O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O B-PER I-PER O O B-ORG I-ORG O
642	All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences .	B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O
643	The change is being demanded by the students .	O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O
644	A little secret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amount of sway .	O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O
645	Few choose to use it , but if they want they can fundamentally change their school .	B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER O B-PER O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
646	Right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes , are initiating service projects , forming support group for social entrepreneurs , inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability , social investing , non-profit innovations , etc. Net Impact is often at the center of these efforts .

647	These are not isolated events ... This is a revolution from within .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
648	I have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that these students are having in the world of business and society at large .	B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
649	In 1776 Adam Smith spoke of enlightened self-interest in The Wealth of Nations .	O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O

651	I am excited and hopeful that this new generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front and center .	B-PER O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O
652	If you are an MBA student and want a good reference for comparing how MBA programs integrate issues of sustainability and social responsibility into the student experience a good place to start is the Beyond Grey Pinstripes report produced by The Aspen Institute .

658	I admit I 've already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies .	B-PER O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG B-ORG I-ORG O

675	Hard to say .	O O O O
676	Both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth .	B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

678	Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks .	O B-PER O O O O O O B-ORG O
679	I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday .	B-PER O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
680	However , my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .	O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O
681	This may partially justify a higher P / E ratio .	O O O O O O O O O O O
682	A couple weeks ago , I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators .	O O O O O B-PER O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O
683	Starbucks , on the other hand , has uniformly strong organizational indicators .	B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O
684	Starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators .	B-ORG O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O
685	Not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators .	O O O B-ORG O O O O B-PER O O B-PER O O O
686	Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator .	B-ORG O O O O O O O O O
687	In the past , several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues .	O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O B-ORG O B-PER O O O O O O O O O
688	The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries .	O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
689	This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
690	Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis , several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O
691	1 .	O O
692	Starbucks has little debt .	B-ORG O O O O
693	Starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt .	B-ORG O O O O B-ORG O O O O
694	Considering its growth , this is amazing .	O B-ORG O O O O O O
695	It also means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth .	O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O
696	The company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting its risk profile because ... 2 .	B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O
697	Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position .	B-ORG O O O O O O O O O
698	This allows the company to grow without debt .	O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O
699	You could argue that Starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders .	B-PER O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O
700	This option is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future .	O O O O O O B-ORG O O B-ORG O O O O O
701	3 .	O O
702	Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits franchising .	B-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-FAC I-FAC O O O O
703	While Starbucks does partner ( airlines , airports , Barnes & amp ; Noble ) , most of its stores are company owned .	O B-ORG O O O B-ORG O B-FAC O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O B-FAC I-FAC B-FAC I-FAC O B-ORG O O
704	From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures , product changes , and quality control .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
705	Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future .	O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
706	I cannot say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P / E ratio than the industry norm .	B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
707	Risk is lower .	O O O O
708	Interesting aside : Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme .	O O O B-ORG O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC B-PER I-GPE B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC B-ORG I-ORG O
